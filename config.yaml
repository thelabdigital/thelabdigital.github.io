    content: |-
              I'm a strategic marketing professional from Myanmar with a solid background in media, marketing, communication, and advertising. I began my career at 19 in Dubai's hospitality industry, transitioned to Myanmar's print media sector in 2010, and by 2016 was developing digital and social media strategies at "Ogilvy Myanmar". Later, I became "Head of Digital Sales and Marketing" at "The Irrawaddy Media", one of Myanmar's leading digital media outlets, and co-founded "The Lab Digital", an agency supporting local MSMEs and NGOs. I've also worked as a Consultant and freelanced for organizations of all sizes, including "[Hogarth Worldwide](https://www.hogarth.com)", "[ICAP at Columbia University](https://icap.columbia.edu)", and "[Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar](https://ispmyanmar.com/)".

              Outside of work, I'm a reader, writer, blogger and online educator, teaching classes via Zoom on topics like business strategy, marketing, data analytics, and operational research to inspire Myanmar's next generation of marketers. In my free time, I enjoy coding for fun (Python, PHP, R, and SQL, if you're curious), exploring Buddhist ethics in business strategies, and geeking out on Indian/Hindu astrology. (Check out my GitHub to learn more about my Python project on Hindu astrology.) I'm also a lifelong Manchester United fan and a proud cat parent.

              Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills in developing and optimizing strategies, consumer behavior and marketing, and data analytics, AI in marketing, and business ethics. If you're looking for someone versatile, adaptable, and ready to make an impact, let's connect!

          I joined The Irrawaddy in Sep 2017 as a digital sales and marketing officer. Back then my main responsibilities was to generate revenue from advertising. But six months later, I was promoted as a digital sales and marketing manager. Then my responsibilities were no longer limited to sell ads spaces and were extended to diversify The Irrawaddy’s revenue sources not only exploring new opportunities but also strengthening the existing ones. My primary responsibilities there were:

          - Assisting Win Thu, independent director back then and Sanjay Gathia, then project director - fundraising, to develop project proposals.
          - Maintaining communications and relationships with donors such as MDIF, NED and Partners Asia.

          - Engaging different communities and organizations to explore new business opportunities.
          -  Researching and analyzing market trends and data such as PESTLE factors to develop new business opportunities and optimize existing ones.

          During Covid pandemic, the media industry was hit by the unprecedented downturn. The Irrawaddy was no longer able to afford my salary and I left the organization.
